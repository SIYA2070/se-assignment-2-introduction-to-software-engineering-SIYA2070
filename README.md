Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 

**What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?**

Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It includes the Design, development, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance of software products. Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, it encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept to maintenance it follows well-defined processes and methodologies. Traditional Engineering focuses on the coding phase of software development it does not have follow formal processes or methodologies and can be done by a small team.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**
**Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.**

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a process that is structured and used by software engineers to design, develop, and test high-quality software products. The SDLC consists of several phases viz:
*Requirements* - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
*Planning* - Estimating the time an resourcing that will be needed and developing a project plan.
*Design* - Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
*Implementation* - Writing a code and building a software according to the design specifications.
*Testing* - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards standards and functional requirements.
*Deployment* - Releasing software to users of customers.
*Maintenance* - Providing for ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

**Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?**

Agile and Waterfall are two predominant methodologies used in software development. 
Waterfall is a sequential approach with a distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfall,from "requirements" to "Maintenance" each phase has to be completed before the next one begins and it is usually used for short projects. 
Agile is interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to change and usually used  for a long term project.

**What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.**
**Software Design Principles**

Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for the design, development, and validation of the software product.
The RE process can be broken down into several key activities:Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis, Requirements Specification, Requirements Validation, Requirements Management.

**Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?**

The concept of modularity in software design means breaking down a big software project into smaller, manageable parts called modules. Each module handles a specific task or feature.
-Instead of dealing with one big chunk of code, developers work with smaller, easier-to-understand modules.
-If there's a problem, it's easier to find and fix in a small module than in a huge mess of code.
-If you need to change something, you can just focus on that specific module without worrying about the rest of the   
 project.
-Modules can be reused in other projects, saving time and effort.
-You can add more modules as needed, making the software grow smoothly.
-Different teams can work on different modules at the same time without stepping on each other's toes.

**Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?**

-Unit testing is done by programmers as they write codes, it checks small parts of the software (like tiny Lego pieces) to make sure they work correctly.
-Integration testing is done by both programmers and testers, it checks how the small parts of the software fit together (like connecting Lego pieces). It identifies issues that arise when combining units into larger modules.
-System testing is done by testers and users, it tests the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements, it validate the system's compliance with functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance and reliability.
Acceptance testing is done by a special testing team or users it checks if the software works like the users expect it to (like checking if a toy does what it's advertised to do).
Testing is crucial in the software because it itdentifies Bugs, Ensuring Quality, Validating Requirements, Reducing Risks, Improving User Satisfaction, Saving Time and Costs, Building Confidence, Facilitating Continuous Improvement

**What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.**

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that track and manage changes to files and folders over time. They enable multiple people to collaborate on a project, track changes, and maintain a history of revisions. 
The importance of VCS in software development are:
*Team Collaboration* VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, avoiding conflicts and ensuring smooth collaboration.
*History Tracking* It keeps a record of all changes made to files, helping developers understand the project's evolution and facilitating troubleshooting.
*Branching and Merging* VCS allows for the creation of separate lines of development (branches), making it easy to isolate new features or fixes without disrupting the main codebase.
*Backup and Recovery* It serves as a backup mechanism, ensuring that code is not lost even if local copies are accidentally deleted or corrupted.
*Conflict Resolution* VCS provides tools to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers make conflicting changes to the same file.
*Code Reviews* It facilitates code reviews by allowing developers to review changes made by their peers before they are merged into the main codebase.
*Auditing and Compliance* VCS logs all changes made to files, providing an audit trail that can be useful for compliance purposes or identifying security breaches.
A popular example of VCS is Git. The features of Git is Distributed version control, branching and merging, lightweight branching, offline support, speed, and flexibility.

**Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?**

Project manager oversees the plannning, execution and delivery of software projects They play a pivotal role in ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to specifications.
<u>Their key responsibilites are:</u>
Project Planning
Team Management
Stakeholder Communication
Risk Management
Budgeting and Cost Control
<u>Challanges faced</u>
Resource Allocation
Schedule Pressures
Risk Management
Budget Constraints

**Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?**

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software after its initial release to ensure that it continues to meet the evolving needs of users and remains compatible with changing environments. Maintenance activities are essential for improving software performance, fixing bugs, addressing security vulnerabilities, and adding new features.
<u>Types of maintenance</u>
Corrective Maintenance
Adaptive Maintenance
Perfective Maintenance
Preventive Maintenance
<u>The importance of software maintenance</u>
Addressing User Needs
Improving Software Quality
Enhancing Security
Extending Software Lifespan
Adapting to Technology Changes
Optimizing Resources
Supporting Business Objectives

**What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?**

Some ethical issues that a software engineer might face is Privacy Concerns. Designing systems that collect and process sensitive user data without proper consent or protection can violate privacy rights.
To adhere to ethical standards in their work, software engineers can stay informed about ethical principles, codes of conduct, and industry best practices through continuous learning and professional development.Familiarise themselves with ethical guidelines and standards established by professional organisations.
